# Abstract

## Workshop

In this workshop, students will learn how to setup and configure continuous delivery within Azure using a combination of Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates and Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS). Attendees will do this throughout the use of a new VSTS project, Git repository for source control, and an ARM template for Azure resource deployment and configuration management.

Attendees will be better able to build templates to automate cloud infrastructure and reduce error-prone manual processes. In addition,

-   Create an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template to provision Azure resources

-   Configure continuous delivery with Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS)

-   Configure Application Insights into an application

-   Create a Visual Studio Team Services project and Git repository
